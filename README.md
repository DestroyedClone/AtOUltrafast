The game speed can be set to either Slow or Fast, but there is an inaccessible(?) third option for "Ultrafast". In most cases it behaves identical to Fast, but there's some situations in which ultrafast is coded to behave faster.

## Config
* Ultrafast Requires Fast - If true, ultrafast will only be enabled if the game speed is already set to fast. If false, then it will always be enabled.
